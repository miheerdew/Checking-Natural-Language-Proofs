# Checking Natural Language Proofs

The task of reviewing a natural language proof in mathematics can be difficult as it requires verifying numerous mental calculations. On the other hand, formal language proofs can automatically be verified by using computers. Can we use large language modelling (LLM) tools to verify that a natural langauge proof is correct? 

I think that the problem of checking proofs ought to be easier than the problem of automatic theorem proving. Further, I am really interested in how I can trust tools from an AI system, i.e. in this case to verify that a proof is correct. I think this will involve translating natural langauge proofs to formal langauge proofs.
